## 📘 Project Overview

**MacBook Landing Page** – a React‑based showcase that combines **Three.js** (via `@react-three/fiber`) and **GSAP** scroll animations.  
The page displays a 3D MacBook model that rotates as the user scrolls, while feature boxes fade/slide in sync with the scroll timeline. It’s a learning sandbox for:

- React + Three.js integration
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger animations in a 3D scene
- Responsive handling with `react-responsive`

| React      | 18.x            |
| Three.js   | 0.160.x         |
| GSAP       | 3.12.x          |

### Installation

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/macbook-landing-page.git
cd macbook-landing-page

# install dependencies
npm install   # or `yarn install`
```

### Run locally

## 🛠️ Core Features

| Feature                    | Implementation                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **3D MacBook model**       | Loaded with `@react-three/fiber`; responsive scaling via `react-responsive`.       |
| **Scroll‑driven rotation** | GSAP `timeline` + `ScrollTrigger` attached to `#f-canvas`.                         |
| **Feature boxes**          | Positioned absolutely over the canvas; animated via CSS/GSAP (extendable).         |
| **Video pre‑loading**      | `useEffect` creates hidden `<video>` elements for each feature video to avoid lag. |
| **Suspense fallback**      | Shows a loading message while the GLTF model is being fetched.                     |

## 🧩 Extending the Demo

1. **Add more GSAP timelines** – e.g., fade‑in/out of feature boxes, camera moves, or material changes.
2. **Swap textures** – use `setTexture` from the store to change the MacBook screen on scroll.
3. **Responsive tweaks** – adjust `scale` and `position` based on breakpoints for tablets/phones.
4. **Deploy** – host on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages (`npm run build` → `dist/`).
